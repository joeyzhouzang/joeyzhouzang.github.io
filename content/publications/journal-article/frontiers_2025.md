  Introduction: Ground-level ozone (O3) remains a persistent air quality concern in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province. Understanding long-term trends and spatially explicit details of O3 is important for supporting air quality management in Ontario.

  Method: We construct a high-resolution (daily, 10 km) dataset of maximum daily 8-hour average O3 (MDA8 O3) over Ontario from 2004 to 2023, through a two-step machine learning model. The model has incorporated our hypothesis that accounting for transboundary in uences can enhance the accuracy of O3 estimation.

  Results: Validation against in-situ measurements con rms the hypothesized high accuracy of the dataset (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 4.99 ppb), outperforming the traditional model and two existing datasets. The dataset reveals pronounced spatiotemporal heterogeneity in MDA8 O3 concentrations, which are low in northern Ontario but high in southern Ontario, especially in southwest Ontario. Seasonally, the provincial mean MDA8 O3 peaks in spring (~40 ppb) and dips in autumn (~27 ppb), while spatial MDA8 O3 in summer is most heterogeneous among all seasons, with a peak in southwestern Ontario. From 2004 to 2023, the provincial mean MDA8 O3 shows no signicant trend, while a signi cant decreasing trend (−0.1 ppb/year, p < 0.05) appears in southern Ontario, where MDA8 O3 increases in winter but decreases in summer, both signi cantly. The number of days exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) O3 guideline range from 10 to 80 days in southern Ontario, with a decline of 1–4 days (up to 15%) per year over 2004–2023.

  Discussion: The analysis suggests that O3 in southern Ontario is impacted by both anthropogenic emissions and meteorology. Reductions in O3 precursor emissions have effectively lowered summertime O3 across southern Ontario, partially offsetting the meteorological-driven increase in O3. This MDA8 O3 dataset offers a valuable resource for further research in environmental health, air quality policy, and O3 impact on agriculture.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  This study utilized a high-accuracy machine learning model ($R^2=0.82$) to construct a high-resolution MDA8 O3 dataset for Ontario (2004–2023), characterizing significant spatiotemporal O3 heterogeneity and confirming that despite successful summertime O3 reductions in Southern Ontario, elevated levels remain an air quality concern.
