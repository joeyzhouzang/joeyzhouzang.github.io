abstract: |
  This study utilized a high-accuracy machine learning model ($R^2=0.82$) to construct a high-resolution MDA8 O3 dataset for Ontario (2004–2023), characterizing significant spatiotemporal O3 heterogeneity and confirming that despite successful summertime O3 reductions in Southern Ontario, elevated levels remain an air quality concern.
